**New Features and Improvements (Implementable in one day):**

*   **Dashboard Overview Widgets:** Introduce small, insightful widgets on the main dashboard showcasing critical portfolio metrics. Examples include "Total Portfolio Value," "Today's Change (absolute/percentage)," or "Number of Active Depots." These can leverage existing data from `app/Models/PortfolioHistory.php` and `app/Models/Asset.php`. NOTE: Ai fixed
*   **Transaction Categorization/Tagging:** Implement a basic system to assign categories or tags to transactions. This would involve adding a `category_id` column to the `transactions` table (after creating a `categories` table in a new migration) and integrating a simple dropdown or input field in `app/Livewire/CreateTransaction.php` and `app/Livewire/EditAccount.php`. NOTE: Ai fixed
*   **Quick Search for Assets/Depots:** Enhance usability by adding a search bar to the `app/Livewire/Portfolio.php` or `app/Livewire/Depot.php` components. This allows users to quickly filter their list of assets or depots by name, type, or other relevant fields, providing immediate feedback. NOTE: Ai fixed
*   **Transaction Type Visual Cues:** Improve the readability of transaction lists by displaying small, descriptive icons next to each transaction. For example, a green up arrow for "buy," a red down arrow for "sell," or a dollar sign for "deposit/withdrawal." This would involve minor UI adjustments in the Livewire components that display transactions. NOTE: Ai fixed
